<h3>CURIOUS OLD PAMPHLET.</h3>

  <p>Grubbing among old pamphlets, the following has turned up:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A Fragment of an Essay towards the most ancient Histories of the Old
  and New Worlds, connected. Intended to be carried on in four Parts or
  Æras. That is, from the Creation of all Things to the Time of the Deluge:
  thence to the Birth of Abraham: from that Period to the Descent of Jacob
  and his Family into Egypt: and, lastly, to the Time of the Birth of
  Moses. Attempted to be executed in Blank Verse, 8vo. pp. 59. Printed in
  the year 1765."</p>

  hundreth year, to have assembled his descendants to a kind of jubilee,
  when sacrifices, and other antediluvian solemnities, being observed,

  obedience to the first of men, humbly beseeched the favour to have their
  memories refreshed by a short history of the marvellous things in the
  beginning." Then Adam thus:&mdash;Hereupon the anonymous author puts into
  the mouth of the great progenitor of the human race a history of the
  Creation, in blank verse, in accordance with the Mosaic and orthodox
  account. Concluding his revelations without reference to the Fall, Seth
  would interrogate their aged sire upon what followed thence, when Adam
  excuses himself from the painful recital by predicting the special advent
  in after times of a mind equal to that task:</p>

  that nobody may pay for his folly but himself; that, if his Fragment is

<h3>ERRATA IN PRINTED BIBLES.</h3>

  <p>Mr. D'Israeli, in his <i>Curiosities of Literature</i>, has an article
  entitled "The Pearl Bibles and Six Thousand Errata," in which he gives
  some notable specimens of the blunders perpetrated in the printing of
  Bibles in earlier times. The great demand for them prompted unscrupulous
  persons to supply it without much regard to carefulness or accuracy; and,
  besides, printers were not so expert as at the present day.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The learned Ussher," Mr. D'Israeli tells us, "one day hastening to
  preach at Paul's Cross, entered the shop of one of the stationers, as
  booksellers were then called, and inquiring for a Bible of the London
  edition, when he came to look for his text, to his astonishment and his
  horror he discovered that the verse was omitted in the Bible! This gave
  the first occasion of complaint to the king, of the insufferable
  negligence and incapacity of the London press; and first bred that great
  contest which followed between the University of Cambridge and the London
  stationers, about the right of printing Bibles."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Even during the reign of Charles I., and in the time of the
  Commonwealth, the manufacture of spurious Bibles was carried on to an
  alarming extent. English Bibles were fabricated in Holland for cheapness,
  without any regard to accuracy. Twelve thousand of these (12mo.) Bibles,
  with notes, were seized by the King's printers as being contrary to the
  statute; and a large impression of these Dutch-English Bibles were
  burned, by order of the Assembly of Divines, for certain errors. The
  Pearl (24mo.) Bible, printed by Field, in 1653, contains some scandalous
  blunders;&mdash;for instance, Romans, vi. 13.: "Neither yield ye your
  members as instruments of <i>righteousness</i> unto sin"&mdash;for
  <i>unrighteousness</i>. 1 Cor. vi. 9.: "Know ye not that <!-- Page 392
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page392"></a>{392}</span>the
  unrighteous <i>shall inherit</i> the kingdom of God?"&mdash;for <i>shall
  not inherit</i>.</p>

  <p>The printer of Miles Coverdale's Bible, which was finished in 1535,
  and of which only two perfect copies, I believe, are known to
  exist&mdash;one in the British Museum, the other in the library of the
  Earl of Jersey&mdash;deserves some commendation for his accuracy. At the
  end of the New Testament is the following solitary erratum:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A faute escaped in pryntyng the New Testament. Upon the fourth leafe,
  the first syde in the sixth chapter of S. Mathew, 'Seke ye first the
  kingdome of heaven,' read, 'Seke ye first the kingdome of God.'"</p>

<h3>IMPOSSIBILITIES OF HISTORY.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">"That unworthy hand."</p>

  <p>I am not aware that the fact of Cranmer's holding his right hand in
  the flames till it was consumed has been questioned. Fox says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He stretched forth his right hand into the flames, and there held it
  so stedfast that all the people might see it burnt to a coal before his
  body was touched."&mdash;P. 927. ed. Milner, London, 1837, 8vo.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Or, as the passage is given in the last edition,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"And when the wood was kindled, and the fire began to burn near him,
  he put his right hand into the flame, which he held so stedfast and
  immovable (saving that once with the same hand he wiped his face), that
  all men might see his hand burned before his body was
  touched."&mdash;<i>Acts and Monuments</i>, ed. 1839, vol. viii. p.
  90.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Burnet is more circumstantial:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"When he came to the stake he prayed, and then undressed himself: and
  being tied to it, as the fire was kindling, he stretched forth his right
  hand towards the flame, never moving it, save that once he wiped his face
  with it, till it was burnt away, which was consumed before the fire
  reached his body. He expressed no disorder from the pain he was in;
  sometimes saying, 'That unworthy hand;' and oft crying out, 'Lord Jesus,
  receive my spirit.' He was soon after quite burnt."&mdash;<i>Hist. of the
  Reformation</i>, vol. iii. p. 429., ed. 1825.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Hume says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He stretched out his hand, and, without betraying either by his
  countenance or motions the least sign of weakness, or even feeling, he
  held it in the flames till it was entirely consumed."&mdash;Hume, vol.
  iv. p. 476.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It is probable that Hume believed this, for while Burnet states
  positively as a fact, though only inferentially as a miracle, that "the
  heart was found entire and unconsumed among the ashes," Hume says, "it
  was pretended that his heart," &amp;c.</p>

  <p>I am not about to discuss the character of Cranmer: a timid man might
  have been roused under such circumstances into attempting to do what it
  is said he did. The laws of physiology and combustion show that he could
  not have gone beyond the attempt. If a furnace were so constructed, that
  a man might hold his hand in the flame without burning his body, the
  shock to the nervous system would deprive him of all command over
  muscular action before the skin could be "entirely consumed." If the hand
  were chained over the fire, the shock would produce death.</p>

  <p>In this case the fire was unconfined. Whoever has seen the effect of
  flame in the open air, must know that the vast quantity sufficient
  entirely to consume a human hand, must have destroyed the life of its
  owner; though, from a peculiar disposition of the wood, the vital parts
  might have been protected.</p>

  <p>The entire story is utterly impossible. May we, guided by the words
  "as the fire was kindling," believe that he <i>then</i> thrust his right
  hand into the flame&mdash;a practice I believe not unusual with our
  martyrs, and peculiarly suitable to him&mdash;and class the "holding it
  till consumed" with the whole and unconsumed heart?</p>

  <p>I may observe that in the accounts of martyrdoms little investigation
  was made as to what was possible. Burnet, describing Hooper's execution,
  says, "one of his hands fell off before he died, with the other he
  continued to knock on his breast some time after." This, I have high
  medical authority for saying, could not be.</p>

<h3>UNREGISTERED PROVERBS.</h3>

  <p>In Mr. Trench's charming little book on <i>Proverbs</i>, 2nd ed., p.
  31., he remarks:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"There are not a few (proverbs), as I imagine, which, living on the
  lips of men, have yet never found their way into books, however worthy to
  have done so; either because the sphere in which they circulate has
  continued always a narrow one, or that the occasions which call them out
  are very rare, or that they, having only lately risen up, have not
  hitherto attracted the attention of any one who cared to record them. It
  would be well, if such as take an interest in the subject, and are
  sufficiently well versed in the proverbial literature of their own
  country to recognise such unregistered proverbs when they meet them,
  would secure them from that perishing, which, so long as they remain
  merely oral, might easily overtake them; and would make them at the same
  time, what all <i>good</i> proverbs ought certainly to be, the common
  heritage of all."</p>

  <p>"<i>Note.</i>&mdash;The pages of the excellent <i>Notes and
  Queries</i> would no doubt be open to receive such, and in them they
  might be safely garnered up," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I trust this appeal of Mr. Trench's will be at once responded to by
  both the editor and correspondents of this periodical. With the former
  <!-- Page 393 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page393"></a>{393}</span>must rest the responsibility of
  withholding from reproduction any proverbs, which though sent him as
  novelties, may be already registered in the recognised collections.</p>

  <p>Mr. Trench's first contribution to this <i>bouquet</i> of the wild
  flowers of proverbial lore is the following, from Ireland:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"'<i>The man on the dyke always hurls well.</i>' The looker on," says
  Mr. Trench in explanation, "at a game of hurling, seated indolently on
  the wall, always imagines that he could improve on the strokes of the
  actual players, and if you will listen to him, would have played the game
  much better than they, a proverb of sufficiently wide
  application."&mdash;P. 32.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Each proverb sent in should be accompanied with a statement of the
  class among whom, or the locality in which, it is current. The index to
  "N. &amp; Q." should contain a reference to every proverb published in
  its pages, under the head of <i>Unregistered Proverbs</i>, or
  <i>Proverbs</i> only. Correspondents should bear in mind the essential
  requisite of a proverb, <i>currency</i>. Curt, sharp sayings might easily
  be multiplied; what is wanted, however, is a collection of such only as
  have that prerequisite of admission into the ranks of recognised
  proverbs. And while contributors should not lose sight of "the stamp of
  merit," as that which renders the diffusion of proverbs beneficial to
  mankind, still they should not reject a genuine proverb for want of that
  characteristic, remembering that,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"'Tween man and man, they weight not every stamp;</p>
      <p>Though light, take pieces for the <i>figure's</i> sake."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And that the mere <i>form</i> of a proverb often affords some
  indication of its age and climate, even where the <i>matter</i> is
  spurious. I have a large MS. collection of English proverbs by me, from
  which I doubt not I shall be able to extract some few which have never
  yet been admitted into any published collection. Of these at some future
  time.</p>

<h3>MR. JUSTICE TALFOURD.</h3>

  <p>The noble sentiments uttered by Justice Talfourd in his last moments
  gave a charm to his sudden death, and shed a hallowed beauty about the
  painfully closing scenes of this great man. I want them to have a niche
  in "N. &amp; Q.," and along with them a passage from his beautiful
  tragedy of <i>Ion</i>, which may be considered as a transcript of those
  thoughts which filled his mind on the very eve of quitting the high and
  honourable duties of his earthly course. It forcibly illustrates the
  loving soul, the kind heart, and the amiable character of this deeply
  lamented judge.</p>

  <p>After speaking of the peculiar aspect of crime in that part of the
  country where he delivered his last charge, he goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I cannot help myself thinking it may be in no small degree
  attributable to that separation between class and class, which is the
  great curse of British society, and for which we are all, more or less,
  in our respective spheres, in some degree responsible, and which is more
  complete in these districts than in agricultural districts, where the
  resident gentry are enabled to shed around them the blessings resulting
  from the exercise of benevolence, and the influence and example of active
  kindness. I am afraid we all of us keep too much aloof from those beneath
  us, and whom we thus encourage to look upon us with suspicion and
  dislike. Even to our servants we think, perhaps, we fulfil our duty when
  we perform our contract with them&mdash;when we pay them their wages, and
  treat then with the civility consistent with our habits and
  feelings&mdash;when we curb our temper, and use no violent expressions
  towards them. But how painful is the thought, that there are men and
  women growing up around us, ministering to our comforts and necessities,
  continually inmates of our dwellings, with whose affections and nature we
  are as much unacquainted as if they were the inhabitants of some other
  sphere. This feeling, arising from that kind of reserve peculiar to the
  English character, does, I think, greatly tend to prevent that mingling
  of class with class, that reciprocation of kind words and gentle
  affections, gracious admonitions and kind inquiries, which often, more
  than any book-education, tend to the culture of the affections of the
  heart, refinement and elevation of the character of those to whom they
  are addressed. And if I were to be asked what is the great want of
  English society&mdash;to mingle class with class&mdash;I would say, in
  one word, the want is the want of sympathy."</p>

  <p>Act I. Sc. 2. After Clemanthe has told Ion that, forsaking all within

      <p>Have their own season. 'Tis a little thing</p>
      <p>To give a cup of water; yet its draught</p>

      <p>It is a little thing to speak a phrase</p>
      <p>Of common comfort, which, by daily use,</p>
      <p>Has almost lost its sense; yet, on the ear</p>
      <p>Of him who thought to die unmourn'd, 'twill fall</p>
      <p>Like choicest music; fill the glazing eye</p>
      <p>With gentle tears; relax the knotted hand</p>

  <p>Before this talented judge was advanced to the bench, he amused
  himself and instructed his clients by occasional <i>metrical</i> notes,
  of which the annexed is a specimen. To make it intelligible to those whom
  it may <i>not</i> concern, I must add an explanation by the attorney in
  the suit, who has obligingly placed the learned serjeant's notes at my
  disposal. This gentleman says: "These notes are in the margin of a brief
  held by the serjeant as leading counsel in an action of ejectment brought
  against a person named Rock, in 1842. In converting into rhyme the
  evidence of the witness Hopkins, as set out in the brief, he has adhered
  strictly to the statements, whilst he has at the same time seized the
  prominent points of the testimony as supporting the case."</p>

<h3>THE SCREW PROPELLER.</h3>

  <p>In 1781, when the steam engine, only recently improved by Watt, was
  merely applied to the more obvious purposes of mine drainage and the
  like, Darwin, in his <i>Botanic Garden</i>, wrote&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Soon shall thy arm, unconquer'd Steam! afar</p>
      <p>Drag the slow barge, or drive the rapid car."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And in an appended note prophecies that the new agent might "in time
  be applied to the rowing of barges, and the moving of carriages along the
  road." The ingenious chronicler of the "loves of the plants," however,
  was in no doubt, when he wrote, aware of the experiments of D'Auxiron,
  Perier, and De Jouffroy; those prosecuted at Dalswinton and in America
  were some years later, about 1787-8 I think. But in another and less
  widely known poem by the same author, the <i>Temple of Nature</i>,
  published in 1802, there occurs a very complete anticipation of one of
  the most important applications of science to navigation, which may prove
  as novel and striking to some of your readers as it did to me. It is,
  indeed, a remarkable instance of scientific prevision. In a note to line
  373, canto ii. of the poem, the author sets out with, "The progressive
  motion of fish beneath the water is produced principally by the
  undulation of their tails;" and after giving the <i>rationale</i> of the
  process, he goes on to say that "this power seems to be better adapted to
  push forward a body in the water than the oars of boats;" concluding with
  the query, "Might not some machinery resembling the tails of fish be
  placed behind a boat so as to be moved with greater effect than common
  oars, by the force of wind or steam?"</p>

<h3>BISHOP ATTERBURY.</h3>

  <p>I have observed in some former Numbers of "N. &amp; Q.," that an
  interest has been manifested in regard to the writings, and especially to
  the letters, of this prelate. It may therefore be interesting to your
  readers to be informed, that an original painting, and perhaps the only
  one, of the Bishop, is preserved at Trelawny House in Cornwall; and from
  its close resemblance to the engraved portrait which is found in his
  works, I have no doubt it is that from which that likeness was taken.
  There are also several letters in the handwriting of Bishop Atterbury
  among the documents preserved in the collection at that ancient mansion.
  That this portrait and the letters should be preserved at Trelawny, is
  explained by the fact, that before his elevation to the episcopal bench,
  Dr. Atterbury was chaplain to Bishop Trelawny.</p>

  <p><i>Hydropathy.</i>&mdash;For a long time, I believe in common with

  that we are indebted for it to Germany, to which we look for all novel
  quackeries (good and bad) in medicine and theology. This belief was put
  to flight a short time ago by a pamphlet which I discovered among others
  rare and curious. It is entitled <i>Curiosities of Common Water, or the
  Advantages thereof in preventing and curing many Distempers</i>. The
  price of the pamphlet was one shilling, and the author rejoices in the
  name of John Smith. After his name follows a motto, the doctrine of which
  it <!-- Page 396 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  searching for a paper dictated to him by Napoleon a long time previously,
  and which he was sorry he could not find, as it was a <i>eulogium on the

  1730, relating to the trial of two men charged with an assault on Andrew

  <p><i>Whittington's Stone on Highgate Hill.</i>&mdash;It is well that
  there is a "N. &amp; Q." to record the removal and disappearance of noted
  objects and relics of antiquity, as one after another disappears before
  the destroying hand of Time, and more ruthless and relentless spirit of
  enterprise. I have to ask you on the present occasion to record the
  removal of Whittington's stone on Highgate Hill. I discovered it as I
  strolled up the hill a few days since. I was informed that it was removed
  about a fortnight since, and a public-house is now being built where it

  <p><i>Turkey and France.</i>&mdash;The following fact, taken from the

  in a corner of "N. &amp; Q."</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I wish to mention a curious fact connected with the port of Toulon,
  and with the long existing relations between France and Turkey, and which
  I have not seen mentioned, although it is recorded in the municipal
  archives of this town. In the year 1543, the sultan, Selim II., at the
  request of the King of France, sent a large army and fleet to his
  assistance, under the command of the celebrated Turkish admiral
  Barbarossa, who, according to the record, was the grandson of a French
  renegade. This army and fleet occupied the town and port of Toulon at the
  express wish of Francis I., from the end of September 1543, to the end of
  March 1544. And on this day, the last of March 1854, a French army and
  fleet has sailed from the same port of Toulon to succour the descendant
  of the Sultan Selim in his distress. What a remarkable example of the
  rise and fall of empires!"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It will not invalidate the force of the foregoing extract to state,
  that Selim II. did not become sultan until 1566, and that it must have
  been his father Suleyman (whom he succeeded) who came to the rescue of
  France in 1543. The same Turkish fleet was afterwards nearly annihilated
  by the Venetians in 1571, at the battle of Lepanto.</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>A FEMALE AIDE-MAJOR.</h3>

  <p>The following is an extract from the letter of the French general,
  Custine, to the National Convention, June 14, 1793:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"My morality is attacked; it is found out that I have a <i>woman</i>
  for my aide-de-camp. Without pretending to be a Joseph, I know too well
  how to respect myself, and the laws of public decency, ever to render
  myself guilty of such an absurdity. I found in the army a woman under the
  uniform of a volunteer bombardier, who, in fulfilling that duty at the
  siege of Liege, had received a musket-ball in the leg. She presented
  herself to the National Convention, desired to continue her military
  service, and was admitted to the honours of the sitting. She was
  afterwards sent by you, Representatives, to the Minister of War, who gave
  her the rank of aide-major to the army. On my arrival here, the
  representatives of the people, commissioners with this army, had
  dismissed her. Her grief was extreme; and the phrenzy of her imagination,
  and her love for glory, would have carried her to the last extremity. I
  solicited the representatives of the people to leave her that rank which
  her merit and wounds had procured her; and they consented to it. This is
  the truth. She is not my aide-de-camp, but <i>attached to the staff as
  aide-major</i>. Since that time I have never had any public or private
  conversation with her."&mdash;From the <i>Political State of Europe</i>,
  1793, p. 164.</p>

  large, that four men together could put their feet in it. Children were
  too terrified to look him in the face, and fled from his presence." So
  says our author; but he does not give the dimensions of Kieten. May not
  such a real giant, in the thirteenth century, have laid the foundation of
  the fabulous stories of giants that have for so many years been the
  favourite romances of the nursery? Kieten appears to be the type of the
  giants of our modern pantomimes. Will he serve as a key, to disclose the

  <p><i>Warwickshire Badge.</i>&mdash;Will you permit me to ask, through

  First Warwickshire. The latter is borne by the 36th regiment of militia,
  they being the First Warwickshire. This latter badge is also borne by the
  retainers of the Earls of Warwick and Leicester; which latter county
  would seem to lay as much claim to the bear and ragged staff as Warwick
  does.</p>

  <p>The county cannot well have both, or either; this makes me think that
  the bear and ragged staff is not a <i>county</i> badge, but pertains more
  properly to the Earl of Warwick.</p>

  station in these go-ahead days, I ask, in what publication was it, that
  in 1780, or thereabouts, being an indefatigable attendant at all
  exhibitions and sales of art, he, the said Humphry, was accustomed (as
  well able he was) to enlighten the public upon what was passing in
  matters of art now nearly three quarters of a century ago? Was it the

  were left as a valued memorial for his children: it may be imagined,
  therefore, that they contain details of a private nature, which would be
  found devoid of interest to the world. Mr. Repton, indeed, possessed a
  mind as keenly alive to the ludicrous, as it was open to all that was
  excellent, in the variety of characters with whom his extensive
  professional connexions brought him acquainted; and he did not fail to
  observe and note down many curious circumstances and traits of character,

  <p>"<i>Oriel.</i>"&mdash;I should be glad if any of your correspondents

<div class="note">
  <p>[<i>Oriol</i>, or <i>Oriel</i>, is a portico or court; also a small
  room near the hall in monasteries, where particular persons dined.
  (Blount's <i>Glossog.</i>) Du Cange says, "<i>Oriolum</i>, porticus,
  atrium;" and quotes Matthew Paris for it. Supposed by some to be a
  diminutive from <i>area</i> or <i>areola</i>. "In modern writings," says
  Nares, "we meet with mention of <i>Oriel</i> windows. I doubt the
  propriety of the expression; but, if right, they must mean those windows
  that project like a porch, or small room. At St. Albans was an
  <i>oriel</i>, or apartment for persons not so sick as to retire to the
  infirmary. (Fosbroke's <i>Brit. Monachism</i>, vol. ii. p. 160.) I may be
  wrong in my notion of <i>oriel</i> window, but I have not met with
  ancient authority for that expression. Cowel conjectured that
  <i>Oriel</i> College, in Oxford, took its name from some such room or
  portico. There is a remarkable portico, in the farther side of the first
  quadrangle, but not old enough to have given the name. It might, however,
  be only the successor of one more ancient, and more exactly an
  <i>oriel</i>." For articles on the disputed derivation of this term,
  which seems involved in obscurity, see Parker's <i>Glossary of

  sink in and turn it black. To produce a polished surface, a hot iron must
  be rubbed over the leather. The following is, however, an easier, if not
  a better, method. Purchase some "bookbinders' varnish," which may be had
  at any colour shop; clean the leather well, as before; if necessary, use

<h3>KING JAMES'S IRISH ARMY LIST, 1689.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ix., pp. 30, 31.)</p>

  <p>My collections are arranged for illustrating, in the manner alluded to
  in the above notice, upwards of four hundred families. In Tyrconnel's
  <i>Horse</i>, I find a Dominick <i>Sheldon</i>, Lieut.-Colonel. His name
  appears in the "Establishment" of 1687-8 for a pension of 200<i>l.</i>
  Early in the campaign, he was actively opposed to the revolutionary party
  in Down and Antrim; and was afterwards joined in an unsuccessful
  negotiation for the surrender of Derry. At the battle of the Boyne he
  commanded the cavalry, and in a gallant charge nearly retrieved the day,
  but had two horses shot under him. When Tyrconnel left Ireland for
  France, to aid the cause of the Stuarts, he selected this colonel as one
  of the directory, who were to advise the young Duke of Berwick, to whom
  Tyrconnel had committed the command of the Irish army, and who was
  afterwards so distinguished in the wars of the brigades abroad. After the
  capitulation of Limerick in 1691, Sarsfield, then the beloved commander
  of the last adherents of the cause of the royal exile, intrusted to
  Colonel Sheldon the care of embarking all who preferred a foreign land to
  the new Government; and King James (for, in justice to my subject, I must
  still style him <i>King</i>) especially thanked him for his performance
  of that duty. When his own regiment was brigaded in France, it was
  called, <i>par excellence</i>, "the King's Regiment;" and Dominick
  Sheldon, "an Englishman," was gazetted its Colonel. The successes of his
  gallant band are recorded, in 1702, at the confluence of the Mincio and
  the Po; in 1703, against the Imperialists under Visconti, when he was
  wounded; in the army of the Rhine, and at the battle of Spire within the
  same year, &amp;c. He appears, throughout his career, an individual of
  whom his descendants should be proud; but I cannot discover the house of
  this <i>Englishman</i>.</p>

  <p>In the Outlawries of 1691, he is described on one as "of the city of
  Dublin," on another, as "of Pennyburn Mill, co. Derry." No other person
  of his name appears in my whole <i>Army List</i>; although the "Diary"
  preserved in the <i>Harleian Miscellany</i> (old edit., vol. vii. p.
  482.) erroneously suggests a subaltern of his name. In the titular Court
  of St. Germains, two of the name of Sheldon were of the Board of Green
  Cloth. Dr. Gilbert Sheldon was Archbishop of Canterbury in the middle of
  the seventeenth century; and the Sheldons are shown by Burke to be still
  an existing family at Brailes House in Warwickshire, previously in
  Oxfordshire, and <i>semble</i> in Staffordshire. I have made application
  on the subject to Mr. Sheldon of Brailes House, the more confidently as
  the Christian name of "Ralph" is frequent in the pedigree of that family,
  and Colonel Dominick Sheldon had a brother Ralph; but Mr. Sheldon could
  not satisfy me.</p>

  <p>One of the adventurers or soldiers in Cromwell's time, in Ireland, was
  a William Sheldon; who, on the Restoration, in the royal policy of that
  day, obtained a patent for the lands in Tipperary, which <!-- Page 402
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page402"></a>{402}</span>the usurping
  powers had allotted for him by certificate. Could Colonel Dominick have
  been his relative?</p>

  <p>I pray information on this subject, and any others connected with the
  <i>Army List</i>, with any documentary assistance which, or the
  inspection of which, the correspondents of "N. &amp; Q." may afford me;
  and such services will be thankfully acknowledged. If I were aided with
  such by them, and by the old families of Ireland, the work should be a
  gem.</p>

<h3>OATHS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., no. 364, 605.; Vol. ix., p. 45.)</p>

  <p>I am extremely obliged to your several correspondents who have replied
  to my Query.</p>

  <p>I now send you "a remarkable case," which occurred in 1657, and throws
  considerable light upon the subject.</p>

  <p>Dr. Owen, Vice-Chancellor of Oxford, being a witness for the plaintiff
  in a cause, refused to be sworn in <i>the usual manner, by laying his
  right hand upon the book, and by kissing it afterwards</i>; but he caused
  the book to be held open before him, and he raised his right hand;
  whereupon the jury prayed the direction of the Court whether they ought
  to weigh such evidence as strongly as the evidence of another witness.
  Glyn, Chief Justice, answered them, that in his opinion he had taken <!--
  Page 403 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page403"></a>{403}</span>as
  strong an oath as any other of the witnesses; but he added that, if he
  himself were to be sworn, he would lay his right hand upon the book
  itself (<i>il voilt deponer sa maine dexter sur le liver mesme</i>). Colt
  <i>v.</i> Dutton, 2 Siderfin's <i>R.</i> 6.</p>

  <p>This case shows that the usual practice at the time it was decided
  was, not to take the book in the hand, but to lay the hand upon it. Now,
  if a person laid his hand upon a book, which rested on anything else, he
  most probably would lay his fingers upon it, and, if he afterwards kissed
  it, would raise it with his fingers at the top, and his thumb under the
  book; and possibly this may account for the practice I mentioned of the
  Welsh witnesses, which, like many other usages, may have been once
  universally prevalent, but now have generally ceased.</p>

  <p>With regard to kissing the book, so far from assuming that it was
  essential, I stated that "in none of these instances does kissing the
  book appear to be essential." Indeed, as, "upon the principles of the
  common law, there is no particular form essential to an oath to be taken
  by a witness; but as the purpose of it is to bind his conscience, every
  man of every religion should be bound by that form which he himself
  thinks will bind his own conscience most" (per Lord Mansfield, Chief
  Justice, Atcheson <i>v.</i> Everitt, Cowper's <i>R.</i> 389.), the form
  of the oath will vary according to the particular opinion of the
  witness.</p>

  <p>Lord Mansfield, in the case just mentioned, referred to the case in
  Siderfin, and stated that "the Christian oath was settled in very ancient
  times;" and it may, perhaps, be inferred that he meant that it was so
  settled in the form there mentioned; but, as he inaccurately translates
  the words I have given thus, "If I were sworn, <i>I would kiss the
  book</i>," it may be doubtful whether he did not consider kissing the
  book as a part of the form of the oath so settled.</p>

  <p>I cannot assent to the opinion of Paley, that the term
  <i>corporal</i>, as applied to oath, was derived from the
  corporale&mdash;the square piece of linen on which the chalice and host
  were placed. The term doubtless was adopted, in order to distinguish some
  oaths from others; and it would be very strange if it had become the
  invariable practice to apply it to all that large class of oaths, in
  every civil and criminal tribunal, to which it did not apply; and when it
  is remembered that in indictments (which have ever been construed with
  the strictest regard to the truth of the statements contained in them)
  this term has always been used where the book has been touched, and where
  the use of the term, if incorrect, would inevitably have led to an
  acquittal, no one I think can doubt that Paley is in error.</p>

  <p>In addition to the authorities I before referred to, I may mention
  that Puffendorff clearly uses the term in the sense I attributed to it;
  and so does Mr. Barbeyrac, in his note to "corporal oath," as used by
  Puffendorff, where he says: "Juramentum corporale, or, as it is called in
  the code, juramentum <i>corporaliter</i> præstitum;" and then refers to a
  rescript of Alexander, where the terms used are "jurejurando
  <i>corporaliter</i> præstito." (Puffendorff, <i>Law of Nature and
  Nations</i>, lib. iv. ss. 11. and 16., pp. 345. and 350.: London, 1729.)
  And it seems very probable that the term came to us from the Romans; and
  as it appears from the books, referred to in the notes to s. 16., that
  there were some instances in which an oath had been taken by proxy, it
  may, perhaps, be that the term <i>corporal</i> was originally used to
  distinguish such oaths as were taken by the party himself from such as
  were taken by proxy.</p>

  <p>The word corporale plainly is the "<i>corporale</i> Linteum," on which
  the sacred elements were placed, and by which they were covered; and no
  doubt were so used, because it covered or touched what was considered to
  be the very body of our blessed Lord. In fact, the term is the same,
  whether it be applied to oath or cloth; and when used with oath, it is
  used in the same sense as our immortal bard uses it in "corporal
  suffering" and "corporal toil."</p>

  <p class="author">S. G. C.</p>

  <p>As the various forms in which oaths have been administered and taken
  is a question not altogether devoid of interest, I would wish to add a
  few words to what I have already written upon this subject. The earliest
  notice of this ceremony is probably that which is to be found in Genesis
  xxiv. 2, 3.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled
  over all that he had. Put, I pray thee, <i>thy hand under my thigh</i>;
  And I will make thee swear," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>That at a very early period the soldier swore by his sword, is shown
  by the Anglo-Norman poem on the conquest of Ireland by Henry II.,
  published by Thomas Wright, Esq.: London, 1837, p. 101.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Morice par sa espé ad juré,</p>
      <p>N' i ad vassal si osé."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In a charter of the thirteenth century, made by one Hugh de Sarnefelde
  to the Abbey of Thomascourt in Dublin, of a certain annuity, we find the
  passage:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Et sciendum quod jam dictus Adam de Sarnefelde <i>affidavit in
  manu</i> Magistri Roberti de Bedeford pro se et heredibus suis quod
  fideliter et absque omni fallacia persolvent, etc. redditum
  prenominatum."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And such clauses are probably of frequent occurrence in ancient
  charters. The expression "affidavit in manu" may be perhaps explained by
  referring to the mode in which the oath of homage was accustomed to be
  taken. This form, as it was of old time observed in England, is, I
  presume, <!-- Page 404 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page404"></a>{404}</span>fully described in other publications; but
  as many of the most valuable of the ancient public records of Ireland
  have been, and are still, in a sadly neglected state, it is not probable
  that the following description of the manner in which certain of the
  Irish chieftains in the time of Richard II. performed their homage to
  Thomas Earl of Nottingham, his deputy, has been hitherto printed:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Gerraldus O'Bryn predictus zonam, glaudium et capitium ipsius a se
  amovens, et genibus flexis ad pedes dicti domini comitis procedit, ambas
  manus suas palmis [adgremium] junctis erigens, et inter manus dicti
  domini comitis crectas tenens, protulit hec verba in lingua hibernicana,"
  &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Inquisition deposited in the Exchequer Record Office,
  Dublin; James I.</i> No. 84.</p>

<h3>REMUNERATION OF AUTHORS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 81.)</p>

  <p>Some time ago I suggested, in the columns of "N. &amp; Q.," a
  collection which might prove interesting, of the remuneration received by
  authors for their works, sending my first instalment thereof. A
  correspondent (W.&nbsp;R.) has since contributed to the stock; and I now beg
  to add a few more cases which have lately occurred to me. In the
  instances of plays, &amp;c., I have confined myself to the sums paid for
  the copyright; any remuneration accruing to the author from the
  performance, a share of the profit, benefit, &amp;c. &amp;c. being too
  diffuse to bring into a tabular form; and, in the case of works published
  while that servile system was in vogue, I have not attempted to record
  the amounts paid for dedications by the inflated "patrons," nor even
  those raised by subscription, except in one or two cases, where such was
  (which was rarely the case) a genuine transaction:</p>

<h3>OCCASIONAL FORMS OF PRAYER.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 535.)</p>

  <p>The list of Occasional Forms of Prayer, recently contributed to your
  pages by the <span class="sc">Rev. Thomas Lathbury</span>, contained no
  less than forty-eight items. All the forms which he enumerates, with one
  exception, are earlier than the year 1700. Using the same limitation of
  date, I send you herewith a farther list of such occasional forms: all
  these are to be found in the British Museum, and the press-marks by which
  they are designated in the catalogue are here added. The present list
  comprises fifty-one items, all of them, I think, different from those
  which have been already mentioned. Unless otherwise stated, the copies of
  the forms here referred to are printed at London, and they are for the
  most part in black-letter, without pagination.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Photographic Query.</i>&mdash;Given the diameter and focal length
  of a simple achromatic lens; at what distance from it must a diaphragm of
  given diameter be placed to give the best possible image?</p>

  <p class="author">O.</p>

  <p><i>Improvement in Collodion.</i>&mdash;As there are many photographers
  who are not members of the Photographic Society, and who do not see the
  journal published by that body, a statement of what I think will be found
  a very material improvement in the manufacture of collodion may not be
  unacceptable to the readers of "N. &amp; Q." To five drachms of pure
  <i>washed</i> ether, add one drachm alcohol 60° over proof, and dissolve
  therein sufficient soluble cotton to make it of the consistence of oil
  (the exact quantity must depend rather upon the dexterity of the
  operator, as the thicker it is the more difficult to use) then add twenty
  minims of chloroform, dropping in the latter, which will fall to the
  bottom, but is readily dissolved on shaking the mixture for a few
  minutes.</p>

  <p>To two drachms of the same alcohol add the iodizing material
  preferred, and mix with the other ingredients.</p>

  <p>The above will be found to flow very evenly smoothly over the plate;
  is tough, intense, and <i>structureless</i> in appearance. I have not yet
  determined what is the best iodizing mixture, but at present I prefer
  iodide of potassium <i>alone</i>, if pure, and twenty grains to the ounce
  of alcohol is the proportion I generally adopt; thus having five grains
  in each ounce of collodion.</p>

  <p>Lastly, as regards the soluble cotton, I cannot find any better
  material than that produced according to the formula published by Mr.
  Hadow, in the March Number of the <i>Photographic Journal</i>, thus:
  "Take of nit. potash, five parts; sulphuric acid, ten parts; water, one
  part; <i>all by weight</i>. Add the water to the nitrate of potash, and
  then the acid, and immediately immerse as much cotton wool as can be
  thoroughly saturated by the mixture, leaving it in for <i>at least</i>
  ten minutes, and wash with a great abundance of water. The object of
  adding the cotton immediately that the acid has been mixed with the
  nitrate of potash, is to expose it to the action of the chemicals while
  they are at a temperature of from 120° to 130°. For farther particulars
  on this head, I must refer to Mr. Hadow's paper.</p>

  <p><i>Photographic Excursions.</i>&mdash;A few Fellows of the Society of
  Antiquaries have formed themselves into a Photographic Club for the
  purpose of making periodical excursions into the country, and so securing
  accurate views of the objects of antiquarian interest in the different
  localities they may visit. As it is intended that a copy of every
  photograph so taken shall be deposited in the portfolios of the Society,
  the advantages likely to result from this little reunion, both to the
  Society of Antiquaries and to Archæology generally, are very obvious.</p>

<h2>Replies to Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p>"<i>To Garble</i>" (Vol. ix., pp. 243. 359.).&mdash;I venture, with
  deference, to express a doubt as to whether E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;T.&nbsp;T. has correctly
  defined either the former or the present meaning of the verb <i>to
  garble</i>, when he says "it meant a selection of the good and the
  discarding of the bad parts of anything: its present meaning is exactly
  the reverse of this." The statutes referred to by your correspondent, the
  first enacting that no bow staves shall be sold ungarbled, and the second
  imposing a penalty on the sale of spices and drugs not garbled, appear to
  me to indicate the former meaning of the word to have been the selection
  (picking out) of the <i>bad</i> and the discarding of it. Experience
  shows that in all operations, involving the separation of objects
  worthless and of value, such as weeding, sifting, and winnowing, the
  former is removed from the latter and discarded. This view of the case
  seems to be supported by the fact of the dust and dross sifted from
  spices being called "garbles." The weeder removes weeds from flowers or
  plants, the garbler removes garbles from spices and bad bow staves from
  amongst good ones. Richardson's <i>Dictionary</i> contains the following
  notes under the head <i>Garble</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Fr. <i>Grabeler</i>; It. <i>Garbellare</i>. Cotgrave says, Grabeller,
  to garble spices, &amp;c., (and hence) also to examine precisely, sift
  nearly, look narrowly, search curiously into."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>After giving some examples of its use, Richardson says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"As usually applied in England, to garble is to pick out, sift out
  what may serve a particular purpose, and thus destroy or mutilate the
  fair character of the whole."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>To go no farther, the reports of the parliamentary debates, when a
  "Blue Book" happens to furnish matter for discussion, amply confirm
  Richardson's definition, that <i>to garble</i> is to pick out what may
  serve a purpose. In this sense, however, E.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;T.&nbsp;T. must admit that it
  would be as much garbling to quote all the <i>good</i> passages of a work
  as to quote all the bad ones. May we not then assume the present meaning
  of the word <i>garble</i> to be this&mdash;to quote passages with the
  view of conveying an impression of the ability or intention of a writer,
  which is not warranted by the general scope of the work?</p>

  <p><i>"Lyra Apostolica</i>" (Vol. ix., p. 304.).&mdash;There is, I

  it not been for my absence, he intimates, the Trojans had not gained so

  <p><i>John Bale, Bishop of Ossory</i> (Vol. ix., p. 324.).&mdash;A
  catalogue, professing to be a complete one, of this over-ardent
  reformer's voluminous works, with a portrait, may be seen in Holland's
  <i>Heroölogia Anglica</i>, fol. 165-7. There are some curious notices
  concerning him in Blomefield's <i>History of Norwich</i> (fol. 1741), pp.

  <p><i>Burial in an erect Posture</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 5. 59. 233. 455.
  630.; Vol. ix., p. 279.).&mdash;How strange it is that all of us should
  have forgotten Charlemagne. When his tomb at Aix-la-Chapelle was opened
  by the Emperor Frederic Barbarossa in 1165, "he found the body of
  Charlemagne, not reclining in his coffin, as is the usual fashion of the
  dead, but seated in his throne, as one alive, clothed in the imperial
  robes, bearing the sceptre in his hand, and on his knees a copy of the
  gospels." (See Murray's <!-- Page 408 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page408"></a>{408}</span><i>Handbook to Belgium</i>.) The throne in
  which the body was seated, the sarcophagus (of Parian marble, the work of
  Roman or Greek artists, ornamented with a fine bas-relief of the Rape of
  Proserpine) in which the feet of the dead king were placed, are still
  preserved in the cathedral, where I saw them last year, together with
  some portions of the robes, and some curious ancient embroidery: these
  last are not usually exhibited to strangers.</p>

  <p>"<i>Carronade</i>" (Vol. ix., p. 246.).&mdash;"The folk story," as to
  the derivation of this word (if such a comparatively modern invention
  deserves such an epithet, for the Carron works, I believe, did not exist
  a hundred years ago) is quite correct. This gun is said to have been
  invented in Ireland by General Melville; but having been perfected at
  Carron, it thence took its name.</p>

  <p>Landmann (no mean authority at the beginning of this century), in his
  <i>Questions and Answers on Artillery</i>, says: "The carronade takes its
  name from being first made at Carron."</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">H. T. Ellacombe.</span></p>

  <p>"<i>Largesse</i>" (Vol. v., p. 557.; Vol. ix., p. 209.).&mdash;The use
  of this word is not confined to Essex and Northamptonshire, but extends
  also to Norfolk. It is met with in many parishes in the western division
  of Norfolk: where, at the time of harvest, after accompanying the last
  load of corn home with the procession of the "Harvest Lady," it is
  customary that the labourers on the several farms should go round their
  respective parishes, and collect various sums of money, under the name of
  <i>largesse</i>, at the houses of the chief inhabitants, whether lay or
  clerical. Few were to be met with who refused this species of "black
  mail" thus levied on them; doubtless regarding it as one out of many
  means of testifying their thankfulness to the "Lord of the Harvest" for
  "filling their mouth with good things," and giving them an abundance of
  "corn and wine and oil."</p>

  following in my own collection:</p>

  <p>Besides these may be consulted, the treatise of Gemma, <i>Delle Gemme

  learned researches of Bergman, <i>Sur les Pierres précieuses</i>,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>I may add, that a practical work on the nature and value of precious
  stones, comprehending the opinions and superstitions of the ancients
  respecting them, together with an essay upon engraved gems, an account of
  celebrated collections and specimens, &amp;c., is much wanted, and would
  probably be well received.</p>

  <p><i>Gale of Rent</i> (Vol. viii., pp. 563. 655.).&mdash;The word
  <i>gale</i> is used in the west of Philadelphia in the sense of an
  instalment. Thus, if land is <!-- Page 409 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page409"></a>{409}</span>bought to be paid for in annual sums, one
  of these is called a yearly gale. I have supposed, I cannot now say why,
  that this was an Irish expression.</p>

  <p><i>Cobb Family</i> (Vol. ix., p. 272).&mdash;I have much reason to
  believe that <span class="sc">Mr. Arthur Paget</span> will find a clue to
  his inquiries in the following particulars extracted from documents in my
  possession. The estate of St. Katharine's Hall, or St. Kattern's, near
  Bath, belonged to the family of Blanchard; and in 1748 the property
  passed to the family of Parry of St. Kattern's by marriage with the
  heiress of the Blanchards, who is thus described:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Thomas Parry, and Querinah his wife, niece and heiress-at-law of
  William Blanchard, who was only son and heir of Henry Blanchard, and
  Querinah his wife," [only child of John Curle, Esq.].</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In 1795 Thomas Parry devised the estate to his son John Parry, who was
  the rector of Sturmer, co. Essex; and by his will [May, 1797] his
  property went to his sisters, Elizabeth Knight, Querinah Cobb, and Hannah
  Parry. Elizabeth married, Aug. 1781, Henry Knight of Lansdown, near Bath.
  Querinah married, Nov. 1781, William Milles Cobb, of Ringwood, gentleman,
  third son of Christopher Cobb, merchant, and Sarah his wife.</p>

  <p>I have in my possession some portraits of the Blanchard, Curle, and
  Parry families; two by Sir Peter Lely, which may afford <span
  class="sc">Mr. Paget</span> farther evidence of the consanguinity of
  Richard Cobb, Esq., and the Cobbs of Ringwood.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. Knight.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Aylestone.</p>

  <p>On the principle that every little helps, and out of gratitude for
  <span class="sc">Cranmore's</span> assistance in the Milton-Minshull
  controversy, I would offer the following suggestions, which may haply
  serve as finger-posts to direct him on his way. William Cobb, Esq., of
  Adderbury, Oxon, immediate ancestor of the baronets of that name and
  place, derived from the Cobbs of Sandringham, in the hundred of
  Freebridge, Norfolk. Blomefield's <i>History</i> of the latter county
  might be consulted with advantage. The Cobbs of Adderbury bore "Sable, a
  chevron argent between three dolphins naiant embowed or, a chief of the
  last." Randle Holme, in his <i>Academy of Armory</i>, 1688, gives the
  following as the arms of Cobb,&mdash;"Per chevron sable and gules, two
  swans respecting each other and a herring cobb argent." Thomas Cobb, of
  Otterington, Yorkshire, a loyal subject of King Charles I., compounded
  for his estates in the sum of 472<i>l.</i> There is a brass in Sharnbrook
  Church, Bedfordshire, commemorating William Cobbe, who died in 1522,
  Alice his wife, a son Thomas, and other children.</p>

  <p>"<i>Aches</i>" (Vol. ix., p. 351.).&mdash;I am not aware of any rhyme
  which fixes the pronunciation of <i>aches</i> in the time of Shakspeare,
  but I think the following quite as decisive:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Of the Fallacie in the Accent or Pronunciation.</i>&mdash;The
  fallacie of the accent is, when a false thing is affirmed under colour of
  pronouncing it as another thing that is true. For example:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Where no <i>ache</i> is, there needs no salve;</p>

  <p><i>Polygamy</i> (Vol. ix., p. 246.).&mdash;The practice of monogamy
  had been established among the Jews before the Christian era, as is shown
  by various expressions in the New Testament; but their law (like that of
  other oriental nations) still permitted polygamy, and they were expressly
  prohibited by an enactment of the Emperor Theodosius, of the year 393,
  from marrying several wives at the same time (Cod. 1. 9. 7.); so that the
  practice was not then extinct among them. Monogamy was the law and
  practice of all the Greek and Italian communities, so far back as our
  accounts reach. There is no trace of polygamy in Homer. Even in the
  incestuous marriages supposed by him in the mythical family of Æolus, the
  monogamic rule is observed, <i>Odyssey</i>, x. 7. The Roman law
  recognised monogamy alone, and hence polygamy was prohibited in the
  entire Roman empire. It thus became practically the rule of Christians,
  and was engrafted into the canon law of the Eastern and Western
  Churches.</p>

  <p><i>Wafers</i> (Vol. ix., p. 376.).&mdash;I have in my possession a
  volume of original Italian letters, addressed to a Venetian physician
  (who appears to have been eminent in his profession), Michael Angelo
  Rota, written during the early part of the seventeenth century. Many of
  these letters have been sealed with red wafers, still adhering to the
  <!-- Page 410 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page410"></a>{410}</span>paper, and precisely similar to those now
  in use. The earliest of the letters which I have found sealed is dated
  April, 1607, which is seventeen years earlier than the earliest known
  instance, mentioned by Beckmann (<i>History of Inventions</i>, Bohn's
  edit., vol. i. p. 146.), of a letter sealed with a wafer.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>The Northern Antiquaries set their brethren in this country a noble
  example. Every year sees one or more of them engaged in the production of
  carefully-edited volumes of early Scandinavian history. We have now to
  record the publication, by Professor Munch, of the old Norse text of
  <i>Kong Olaf Tryggvesön's Saga</i> from a MS. in the Library at Stockholm
  which has not hitherto been made use of; and also, by the same gentleman,
  in conjunction with his friend Professor Unger, of an edition of the
  <i>Saga Olafs Konungs ens Helga</i>, from the earliest MS. in the library
  at Stockholm. Each work is introduced by a preface of great learning, and
  illustrated by a large body of valuable notes.</p>

  <p>Those who have shared our regret, that the brilliant notices of books
  which occasionally appear in the columns of <i>The Times</i> should be
  presented in a form which scarcely admits of their being preserved, and
  also our satisfaction when Mr. Murray put forth his selection from them
  under the title of <i>Essays from the Times</i>, will be glad that the
  same publisher has issued in his <i>Railway Reading</i> a Second Series
  of them, comprising fourteen articles.</p>

  <p>We may remind all lovers of beautiful illustrations of Mediæval Art,
  that Messrs. Sotheby and Wilkinson will sell by auction on Monday next
  the entire stock of the magnificent publications of Mr. Henry Shaw,
  F.S.A., whose <i>Dresses and Decorations of the Middle Ages</i> are a
  type of the whole. Such an opportunity of securing copies at a reasonable
  rate will never occur again. While on the subject of sales, we may
  mention that Messrs. Puttick and Simpson announce a sale of
  <i>Photographs</i>. This is the first instance; but we may be sure, with
  the growing taste for these accurate and, in many cases, also artistic
  transcripts of nature, every season will see many similar sales.</p>

  <p>At the anniversary of the Society of Antiquaries on Monday last,
  Admiral Smyth moved a vote of thanks to <span class="sc">Mr.
  Bruce</span>, on his retirement from the Treasurership, for his zeal and
  indefatigable exertions in that office. The manner in which the gallant
  Admiral's remarks were received showed, first, that the reforms advocated
  by Mr. Bruce now meet the general approval of the Society; and secondly,
  that the warmth of feeling which they had called forth on both sides has
  entirely disappeared.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received.</span>&mdash;<i>Condé's History of
  the Arabs in Spain, translated from the Spanish</i>, by Mrs. Jonathan
  Foster, in three volumes, Vol. I. Mr. Bohn deserves the best thanks of
  all lovers of history for this English translation&mdash;the first which
  has ever been made&mdash;of the admirable work of Condé. It is one of the
  most important volumes which he has published in his <i>Standard
  Library.&mdash;The Diary and Letters of Madame D'Arblay</i>, Vol. II. The
  second volume of this amusing, gossiping, and egotistical work, comprises
  the period 1781-1786.&mdash;<i>Pantomime Budgets, &amp;c.</i>, a clever
  pamphlet in favour of prepaid taxation.&mdash;<i>John Penry, the Pilgrim
  Martyr</i>, 1559-1593, by John Waddington. A violent anti-church
  biography of Penry, whose share in the Marprelate Controversy Mr.
  Waddington disbelieves on very insufficient grounds.</p>

  PIANOFORTES, at 25 guineas each. Every instrument warranted. The peculiar

  profession, having carefully examined the Royal Pianofortes manufactured
  by MESSRS. D'ALMAINE &amp; Co., have great pleasure in bearing testimony
  to their merits and capabilities. It appears to us impossible to produce
  instruments of the same size possessing a richer and finer tone, more
  elastic touch, or more equal temperament, while the elegance of their
  construction renders them a handsome ornament for the library, boudoir,
  or drawing-room. (Signed) J.&nbsp;L. Abel, F. Benedict, H.&nbsp;R. Bishop, J.
